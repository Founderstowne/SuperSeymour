### Current Features:
- **🌈 Rainbow Edge Animation** - Beautiful Siri-style activation effect
- **📖 Reader Mode** - Strip away everything but content
- **🌙 Dark Mode** - Real dark mode for any site
- **⚡ Speed Mode** - Remove tracking, ads, and bloat
- **🧘 Zen Mode** - Minimalist transformation

### The Magic:
- **Zero Installation** - Just a bookmark

- **100% Free** - Forever, no premium tiers
- **Privacy First** - No tracking, no analytics, no BS

---

## 🛡️ Resilient Architecture

SuperSeymour uses multi-server failover for maximum reliability:

1. **GitHub Pages** (Primary) - Fast, reliable hosting
2. **jsDelivr CDN** (Mirror) - Global CDN network
3. **GitHub Raw** (Backup) - Direct from repository

If one server fails, it automatically tries the next. Practically unstoppable.

SuperSeymour isn't just a bookmarklet. It's a statement:

**The future of software isn't downloaded. It's bookmarked.**

When everything you need lives in a bookmark, why do you need:
- App stores?
- Installation wizards?
- Update notifications?
- Storage space?
- Permission popups?

You don't.

You need a browser and a bookmark. That's it.
